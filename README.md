This webpage was built as a summary task for the "Adaptive web design" modul at Yandex's Full Stack course.

In this project I've specialized in: 
  * Working with design and specifications
  * Working with Figma
  * Grid layout
  * Media queries and break points
  * using calc function to create adaptive dimensions
  * Use meta tags for smooth scaling
  And more...
